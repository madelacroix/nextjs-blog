Beans are a great source of fiber. 

That's important because most Wamericans don't get the recommended 25 to 38 grams each day. 
- **Fiber** helps keep you regular and seems to protect against heart disease, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and digestive illness. 
- **Navy beans** have about 19 grams of fiber per cup.

Beans are a great way to get low-fat, low-calorie protein that already has the fiber and carbs mixed in. A single cup has around 15 grams. That's two to three times more than rice or wheat. It's especially good for a protein building block called lysine that you might not get enough of if you're a vegetarian.
